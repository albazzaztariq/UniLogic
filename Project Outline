Pragma is a project encompassing a programming language, hardware optimization algorithm, and operating system written in the language.
The below explains the language.  Currently in testing as of this writing, with the OS far behind the language.

- Uses intuitive, Java-like syntax but with more clarity and completeness.
- Transpiles to C
- Repository includes the following tools:
-- flags for quick AOT sanitzation through A/T/UBSan, CBMC, simple custom array out-of-bounds checker
-- flags for quick PGO and LTO optimization at runtime

Rust is popular and has institutional backing but many complain that it has/is:
- steep learning curve
- unintuitive/confusing syntax
- frustrating to work with when total memory safety isn't important

Pragma compromises by having easier-on-the-eyes syntax than either C or Rust, and provides the same memory safety as Rust.

How?

- Mathematically-proven safety (Frama-C with the WP Plugin, which uses the same mathematical methods Rust uses to prove safety)
- Decentralized signed hash that proves the code you're looking at was mathematically proven (Blockchain technology)

So not only is your code safe, but any libraries/packages you download that are signed are also safe.  And there's a level below full safety available
where only regular sanitizers ran.

Basically the LLM's have made it where the mathematical part is now doable for everyday people - everything else was already there.

It hashes your source file with SHA-256.  When you run the verification pipeline, every tool's full output is collected, hashed, 
and bundled into JSON alongside the source hash and tool versions.  The output is a CID officially, but it is ultimately the hash.
The hash is hosted on Pinata, which right now gives you 1 GB of space on the free tier.  The glue is Solidity, a type of smart contract on Ethereum.
Pinata sits on the IPFS network, which is just a P2P network of hashes.  Whenever someone requests the original timestamped 
hash through IPFS, it checks and finds the hosting node and downloads it.  It'll look something like this:

  "tool_results": [
    { "tool": "cbmc",     "version": "5.95.1", "passed": true,
  "output_hash": "a3f..." },
    { "tool": "asan+ubsan","version": "gcc 13.2.0", "passed": true,
  "output_hash": "b7c..." },
    { "tool": "tsan",     "version": "gcc 13.2.0", "passed": true,
  "output_hash": "d1e..." }
  ]

To verify any piece of code: hash the file yourself with sha256sum file.c, look up that hash in the on-chain registry, fetch the attestation from IPFS using the stored CID, and
optionally re-run CBMC and the sanitizers yourself if they used those.  You'll get byte-for-byte identical results.

No trust required, same safety as Rust with the option to not fight the compiler over it if you want to.

I made two modes of signed code: MemResistant and MemProof.  The former has a lot of tools perform static analysis (listed at top), while the latter does that and formally proves safety mathematically.
So you get 3 options: unsigned, signed as confidence in safety, signed as proven safe.  Gives you the ability to at least in many cases have some confidence that someone didn't bound a buffer somewhere,
to formally proven using the same math that Rust uses.
