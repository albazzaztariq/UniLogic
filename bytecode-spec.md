# UniLogic Bytecode Format Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-03-18

## 1. Design Decision: Register-Based

The UL bytecode uses a **register-based** architecture. Each instruction names its source and destination registers explicitly rather than pushing to and popping from an implicit stack. UL is a new language with no legacy bytecode to maintain — this is the right call to make now rather than retrofitting later.

**Research basis:** Register-based VMs execute 2–3x fewer instructions than stack VMs for equivalent programs, with bytecode only 25–30% larger (Shi et al., "Virtual Machine Showdown," ACM VEE 2005). The instruction count reduction compounds when adding JIT compilation later — fewer bytecode instructions means fewer IR nodes to lower, faster compilation, and better native code. RegCPython — a register-based reimplementation of CPython — confirmed the register architecture is appreciably faster and that "compilation speed is never a reason for choosing stack architecture" (Brito & Valente, ACM SAC 2023).

**Why not stack-based:** CPython 3.11–3.14 invested heavily in the "Faster CPython" project, retrofitting quickening and specialization onto its stack-based interpreter. Even after that work, PyPy remains ~18x faster than CPython 3.14, and ~3x faster than Node.js (Grinberg, 2025). That gap demonstrates the ceiling of the stack-based model even with aggressive optimization. UL avoids this ceiling by starting register-based.

**Compiler cost:** Register allocation adds complexity to the compiler. UL uses a simple linear-scan allocator — each local variable and temporary maps to a register slot at compile time. Functions with more than 256 live values at any point (the register limit per frame) spill to a frame-local memory area. In practice, this limit is never reached in normal code.

**Stack-based fallback:** Stack-based interpretation remains a viable fallback for cold code paths (functions executed rarely or only once). The VM may maintain a simple stack interpreter for cold functions and only promote to the register-based execution model after a function's block hotness counters (§2.5) exceed a threshold. This avoids paying register allocation cost for code that doesn't justify it.

## 2. File Format

A `.ulb` file (UniLogic Bytecode) has the following layout:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  Header              (24 bytes)  │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  Constant Pool       (variable)  │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  Function Table      (variable)  │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  Block Metadata      (variable)  │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  Control Flow Table  (variable)  │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│  Instruction Blocks  (variable)  │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.1 Header

| Offset | Size | Field | Value |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| 0 | 4 | Magic bytes | `0x554C4243` (`ULBC` in ASCII) |
| 4 | 2 | Major version | `0x0100` (1.0) |
| 6 | 2 | Minor version | `0x0000` |
| 8 | 4 | Constant pool entry count | u32 LE |
| 12 | 4 | Function table entry count | u32 LE |
| 16 | 4 | Block metadata entry count | u32 LE |
| 20 | 4 | Control flow edge count | u32 LE |

All multi-byte integers are **little-endian** throughout the file.

### 2.2 Constant Pool

Immediately follows the header. Contains `constant_count` entries, each prefixed by a 1-byte type tag:

| Tag | Type | Encoding |
|-----|------|----------|
| `0x01` | int | 8 bytes, signed 64-bit LE |
| `0x02` | float | 8 bytes, IEEE 754 double LE |
| `0x03` | string | 4 bytes length (u32 LE) + N bytes UTF-8, no null terminator |
| `0x04` | bool | 1 byte (`0x00` = false, `0x01` = true) |
| `0x05` | empty | 0 bytes (null/none literal) |

Constants are referenced by **zero-based index** in instructions.

### 2.3 Function Table

Contains `function_count` entries, each:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|--------|------|-------|
| 0 | 4 | Name length (u32 LE) |
| 4 | N | Name (UTF-8 bytes) |
| 4+N | 1 | Parameter count (u8) |
| 5+N | 1 | Register count (u8, total registers needed including params) |
| 6+N | 4 | Instruction offset (u32 LE, byte offset into instruction block) |
| 10+N | 4 | Instruction count (u32 LE, number of 32-bit instructions) |
| 14+N | 4 | First block metadata index (u32 LE) |
| 18+N | 2 | Block count (u16 LE) |

Functions are referenced by **zero-based index**. The entry point is resolved by name (default: `main`). Register slots 0..param_count-1 hold function parameters on entry.

### 2.4 Instruction Encoding

All instructions are **fixed-width 32 bits** (4 bytes). This simplifies PC arithmetic (`pc += 4` always), makes in-place patching a single aligned write, and improves I-cache utilization.

```
Standard 3-register form:
┌────────┬────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ opcode │  rA    │  rB    │  rC    │
│ 8 bits │ 8 bits │ 8 bits │ 8 bits │
└────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┘

2-register + immediate form:
┌────────┬────────┬─────────────────┐
│ opcode │  rA    │    imm16        │
│ 8 bits │ 8 bits │   16 bits LE    │
└────────┴────────┴─────────────────┘

1-register + wide immediate form:
┌────────┬────────────────────────────┐
│ opcode │         imm24              │
│ 8 bits │        24 bits LE          │
└────────┴────────────────────────────┘
```

The opcode determines which form applies. 256 registers per frame (r0–r255) covers any real function. The compiler assigns registers via linear-scan allocation.

### 2.5 Block Metadata Table

Contains `block_count` entries (one per basic block across all functions). Each entry:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|--------|------|-------|
| Offset | Size | Field |
|--------|------|-------|
| 0 | 4 | Start instruction index (u32 LE, within owning function) |
| 4 | 4 | End instruction index (u32 LE, exclusive) |
| 8 | 1 | Register pressure at entry (u8, highest live register) |
| 9 | 1 | Successor count (u8, max 2 for conditional branches) |
| 10 | 1 | Hotness counter (u8, 6-bit lossy — see below) |
| 11 | 1 | Flags (u8, bit 0 = has full counter, bits 1–7 reserved) |
| 12 | 4 | Successor block indices, packed (u16 LE × 2, or u32 for single successor) |

**Hotness counter model (TinyCounters):** Each block carries a 6-bit lossy counter (values 0–63) in the metadata table. The counter increments on each block entry but saturates at 63. A VM-global timer periodically halves all counters (decay), preventing warm-but-not-hot blocks from triggering JIT. When a counter saturates, the VM promotes that block's function: it sets the `has full counter` flag and allocates a full 32-bit counter in a side table for precise profiling. Only the top ~1% hottest blocks ever get a full counter. This keeps the per-block metadata at 16 bytes while enabling cheap profiling for JIT tiering.

### 2.6 Control Flow Table

Stored after the block metadata. One entry per edge in the control flow graph across all functions.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|--------|------|-------|
| 0 | 4 | Source block index (u32 LE) |
| 4 | 4 | Target block index (u32 LE) |
| 8 | 1 | Edge type (u8: `0x00` = fall-through, `0x01` = branch-taken, `0x02` = branch-not-taken, `0x03` = call, `0x04` = return) |
| 9 | 3 | Reserved / padding |

The control flow table is separate from the instruction stream. Benefits:

- **Branch prediction.** The VM can prefetch likely successor blocks by reading the CFG edge type without scanning instructions.
- **JIT gets CFG instantly.** No need to reconstruct the control flow graph from branch instructions — it's pre-computed by the compiler.
- **Block reordering.** The VM can reorder blocks in memory for hot/cold splitting — hot blocks packed together for I-cache locality, cold blocks pushed to a separate page. The CFG edges remain valid regardless of physical layout.
- **Similar to WebAssembly structured control flow** — the control flow is explicit in the format, not implicit in the instruction stream.

---

## 3. Type Encoding in Registers

Each register holds a tagged value. The tag is stored alongside the value in a discriminated union:

| Tag | Type | Register representation |
|-----|------|----------------------|
| `0x01` | int | signed 64-bit integer |
| `0x02` | float | IEEE 754 64-bit double |
| `0x03` | string | pointer to heap-allocated UTF-8 string |
| `0x04` | bool | 0 or 1 |
| `0x05` | empty | null/none sentinel |

Type tags are carried at runtime for Tier 0 instructions. Tier 1 instructions with type feedback slots may bypass the tag check after specialization (see §7).

---

## 4. Instruction Set

All opcodes are 8 bits. Instructions are 32 bits wide. Opcode numbering places the hottest instructions in the lowest range for I-cache locality and dense jump-table dispatch.

### 4.1 Hot Path — Tier 0 (0x01–0x0F)

| Opcode | Hex | Form | Semantics |
|--------|-----|------|-----------|
| `MOV` | `0x01` | `rA, rB, _` | `rA = rB` |
| `LOAD_CONST` | `0x02` | `rA, imm16` | `rA = constant_pool[imm16]` |
| `ADD` | `0x03` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB + rC` |
| `SUB` | `0x04` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB - rC` |
| `MUL` | `0x05` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB * rC` |
| `DIV` | `0x06` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB / rC` (int truncates, zero = error) |
| `CMP_LT` | `0x07` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = (rB < rC) ? true : false` |
| `JUMP_IF_FALSE` | `0x08` | `rA, imm16` | `if !rA: pc += sign_extend(imm16) * 4` |
| `CALL` | `0x09` | `rA, rB, rC` | Call function `rB` with `rC` args starting at `rA`. Result in `rA`. |
| `RETURN` | `0x0A` | `rA, _, _` | Return value in `rA` to caller |
| `PRINT` | `0x0B` | `rA, _, _` | Print `rA` to stdout |

### 4.2 Arithmetic and Logic — Tier 0 (0x10–0x1F)

| Opcode | Hex | Form | Semantics |
|--------|-----|------|-----------|
| `MOD` | `0x10` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB % rC` |
| `NEG` | `0x11` | `rA, rB, _` | `rA = -rB` |
| `NOT` | `0x12` | `rA, rB, _` | `rA = !rB` (logical) |
| `AND` | `0x13` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB && rC` |
| `OR` | `0x14` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB \|\| rC` |
| `ADD_IMM` | `0x15` | `rA, rB, imm8` | `rA = rB + imm8` (unsigned 8-bit immediate) |
| `SUB_IMM` | `0x16` | `rA, rB, imm8` | `rA = rB - imm8` |

### 4.3 Comparison — Tier 0 (0x20–0x2F)

| Opcode | Hex | Form | Semantics |
|--------|-----|------|-----------|
| `CMP_EQ` | `0x20` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = (rB == rC)` |
| `CMP_NE` | `0x21` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = (rB != rC)` |
| `CMP_GT` | `0x22` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = (rB > rC)` |
| `CMP_LE` | `0x23` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = (rB <= rC)` |
| `CMP_GE` | `0x24` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = (rB >= rC)` |

Note: `CMP_LT` is in the hot path at `0x07`.

### 4.4 Control Flow — Tier 0 (0x30–0x3F)

| Opcode | Hex | Form | Semantics |
|--------|-----|------|-----------|
| `JUMP` | `0x30` | `imm24` | `pc += sign_extend(imm24) * 4` |
| `JUMP_IF_TRUE` | `0x31` | `rA, imm16` | `if rA: pc += sign_extend(imm16) * 4` |
| `RETURN_NONE` | `0x32` | `_, _, _` | Return `empty` |

Note: `JUMP_IF_FALSE` is in the hot path at `0x08`. Jump offsets are in **instruction units** (multiply by 4 for byte offset), signed. Range: ±8M instructions for `JUMP` (imm24), ±32K instructions for conditional jumps (imm16).

### 4.5 Globals — Tier 0 (0x40–0x4F)

| Opcode | Hex | Form | Semantics |
|--------|-----|------|-----------|
| `LOAD_GLOBAL` | `0x40` | `rA, imm16` | `rA = globals[imm16]` |
| `STORE_GLOBAL` | `0x41` | `rA, imm16` | `globals[imm16] = rA` |

### 4.6 Arrays — Tier 0 (0x60–0x6F)

| Opcode | Hex | Form | Semantics |
|--------|-----|------|-----------|
| `NEW_ARRAY` | `0x60` | `rA, rB, rC` | Create array of `rC` elements starting at register `rB`, store in `rA` |
| `INDEX_GET` | `0x61` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB[rC]` (bounds checked) |
| `INDEX_SET` | `0x62` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA[rB] = rC` |
| `LENGTH` | `0x63` | `rA, rB, _` | `rA = len(rB)` |

### 4.7 Kill Bit Variants (0x50–0x5F)

Arithmetic instructions encode whether source operands are **last-use** (killed after this instruction). This enables zero-cost move elision, immediate register reuse, and cleaner SSA lowering in the JIT. The kill bit is encoded in the opcode itself — each base arithmetic op has up to 3 variants:

| Suffix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| (none) | Both operands live after | `ADD r1, r2, r3` — r2 and r3 still needed |
| `.K` | rC killed after | `ADD.K r1, r2, r3` — r3 is last use, register freed |
| `.KK` | rB and rC both killed | `ADD.KK r1, r2, r3` — both freed after this instruction |

| Opcode | Hex | Base op | Kills |
|--------|-----|---------|-------|
| `ADD.K` | `0x50` | ADD | rC |
| `ADD.KK` | `0x51` | ADD | rB, rC |
| `SUB.K` | `0x52` | SUB | rC |
| `SUB.KK` | `0x53` | SUB | rB, rC |
| `MUL.K` | `0x54` | MUL | rC |
| `MUL.KK` | `0x55` | MUL | rB, rC |
| `DIV.K` | `0x56` | DIV | rC |
| `DIV.KK` | `0x57` | DIV | rB, rC |
| `CMP_LT.K` | `0x58` | CMP_LT | rC |
| `CMP_LT.KK` | `0x59` | CMP_LT | rB, rC |

The compiler emits kill variants based on liveness analysis. The base (non-kill) opcode is always valid — kill variants are an optimization, not a requirement. A VM that ignores kill bits produces correct results; it just misses register reuse opportunities.

### 4.8 Memory Access Classes (0x48–0x4F)

Specialized load instructions for different memory access patterns. Each carries enough information for the VM or JIT to select the optimal access strategy.

| Opcode | Hex | Form | Semantics |
|--------|-----|------|-----------|
| `LOAD_STRUCT_FIELD` | `0x48` | `rA, rB, imm8` | `rA = rB.fields[imm8]` — struct field at constant offset. No bounds check needed (offset validated at compile time). |
| `LOAD_ARRAY_SEQ` | `0x49` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB[rC]` — sequential array access (hint: rC is incrementing). Enables prefetch of next element. |
| `LOAD_ARRAY_STRIDE` | `0x4A` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB[rC]` — strided array access (hint: rC advances by a constant stride). Enables stride-based prefetch. |
| `STORE_STRUCT_FIELD` | `0x4B` | `rA, rB, imm8` | `rA.fields[imm8] = rB` |

These are hints to the VM/JIT, not semantic requirements. A VM may execute all of them as generic `INDEX_GET`/`INDEX_SET`. The JIT uses the access pattern information to emit prefetch instructions, select vectorized loads, or avoid redundant bounds checks.

### 4.9 Type Operations — Tier 0 (0x70–0x7F)

| Opcode | Hex | Form | Semantics |
|--------|-----|------|-----------|
| `CAST_INT` | `0x70` | `rA, rB, _` | `rA = int(rB)` |
| `CAST_FLOAT` | `0x71` | `rA, rB, _` | `rA = float(rB)` |
| `CAST_STRING` | `0x72` | `rA, rB, _` | `rA = string(rB)` |
| `CAST_BOOL` | `0x73` | `rA, rB, _` | `rA = bool(rB)` |

---

## 5. Execution Model

1. The VM loads the `.ulb` file, validates magic bytes and version, parses the constant pool, function table, and block metadata into memory.
2. The VM locates the entry-point function (default: `main`) by name.
3. A root call frame is created with a register file of `register_count` slots, all initialized to `empty`.
4. The PC is set to the function's instruction offset.
5. The VM enters the fetch-decode-execute loop:
   - Read 32-bit instruction word at PC.
   - Decode opcode (byte 0), operands (bytes 1–3).
   - Execute. PC += 4 (always, unless a jump modifies PC).
   - Repeat until `RETURN` with no caller frame.
6. Exit code = integer value of the return register from `main`, or 0 if `empty`.

### 5.1 Register File

Each call frame has its own register file of `register_count` slots (specified in the function table). Registers r0..r(param_count-1) are loaded with arguments by the caller. The compiler assigns all locals and temporaries to registers at compile time via linear-scan allocation. No operand stack exists.

### 5.2 Recommended Dispatch Implementation

The main enemy of interpreter performance is **indirect branch misprediction**. Each opcode dispatch is a branch the CPU must predict, and a central `switch` gives the branch predictor a single site shared by all opcodes.

**Primary: direct threaded dispatch** via computed goto (GCC/Clang `&&label` extension). Each handler ends with `goto *dispatch_table[*(uint8_t*)pc]`, jumping directly to the next handler. This gives the branch predictor a separate site per handler. Benchmarks show 15–25% speedup over switch dispatch.

**Fallback: dense jump table.** Use a `switch` with contiguous opcode values. Hot opcodes are numbered `0x01–0x0B` with no gaps so the jump table stays dense and small.

**Never use:** `if/else if` chains. O(n) per dispatch, destroys branch prediction.

**Handler ordering via entropy tuning.** Opcode numbering in this spec places hot instructions at low values for a dense jump table. At runtime, the VM can further optimize by profiling opcode transition frequencies from real workloads and reordering handler code in memory. The metric: sort opcodes by Shannon entropy of their successor distribution (descending) — opcodes with the most predictable successors benefit most from adjacent placement. The load-time rewriting pass (§8) can remap opcode indices to match the optimal handler layout for the specific program being executed.

### 5.3 Versioned Instructions

Each instruction is a **state machine**, not a static operation. The opcode byte encodes both the operation and its current specialization state. Instructions evolve in-place without changing the instruction's structure or position:

```
ADD[v0]  →  ADD_INT[v1]  →  ADD_INT[v2]  →  ADD[v0]  (deopt)
 generic     specialized     confirmed       reverted
```

The version/state is encoded in the opcode value itself (the quickened opcode range `0xC0–0xDF` represents specialized states of the base opcodes `0x01–0x1F`). This enables:

- **Deoptimization without code rewriting** — reverting to generic is a single byte write back to the original opcode. The operand bytes are unchanged.
- **Polymorphic inline caches inside opcodes** — an instruction that sees two types can settle into a megamorphic state (a different quickened opcode) that checks both types before falling back to generic.
- **Profiling-driven evolution** — the VM tracks how many times each instruction has been executed at each specialization level. After N stable executions at v1, promote to v2 (confirmed — skip the type guard entirely). If a type guard fails, demote to v0.

### 5.4 Quickening

After the first execution, the VM may **rewrite an instruction's opcode byte in-place** to a specialized variant. The 32-bit fixed-width format makes this a single aligned byte write with no instruction-stream resizing.

| Original | Quickened | What changes |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `ADD` | `ADD_INT` | Both operands confirmed int — skip type dispatch |
| `ADD` | `ADD_FLOAT` | Both operands confirmed float |
| `CMP_LT` | `CMP_LT_INT` | Both operands confirmed int |
| `CALL` | `CALL_RESOLVED` | Function pointer cached after first name resolution |
| `LOAD_CONST` | `LOAD_CONST_INT` | Constant type cached — skip pool tag check |

Quickened opcodes use the range `0xC0–0xDF`. Never emitted by the compiler. Never present in `.ulb` files on disk. See §7 for the full type specialization plan.

### 5.4 Error Handling

Runtime errors (division by zero, out-of-bounds index, type mismatch, register out of range) halt execution with an error message including the function name and instruction offset. No exceptions or try/catch in v1.0.

---

## 6. Tiered ISA

The instruction set is organized into three tiers. Tier 0 ships in v1.0. Tiers 1 and 2 are designed now and implemented incrementally.

### Tier 0 — Primitive Operations

All instructions in §4. Integer/float arithmetic, register moves, branches, calls, returns. Each maps to one or two machine instructions under JIT. No metadata, no side tables. The baseline that every VM must implement.

### Tier 1 — Semantic Operations (0x80–0x9F)

Instructions that carry **inline cache (IC) metadata indices** for runtime specialization. Each Tier 1 instruction has a `rC` field that indexes into a per-function IC table (not part of the `.ulb` file — allocated by the VM at load time).

| Opcode | Hex | Form | Semantics |
|--------|-----|------|-----------|
| `CALL_IC` | `0x80` | `rA, rB, ic_slot` | Call function in `rB` with IC slot for monomorphic/polymorphic dispatch |
| `FIELD_GET` | `0x81` | `rA, rB, ic_slot` | `rA = rB.field` with type feedback in IC slot |
| `FIELD_SET` | `0x82` | `rA, rB, ic_slot` | `rA.field = rB` with type feedback |
| `ITER_INIT` | `0x83` | `rA, rB, _` | Initialize iterator over array/string in `rB`, store state in `rA` |
| `ITER_NEXT` | `0x84` | `rA, rB, imm8` | Advance iterator `rB`, store value in `rA`, jump +imm8 instructions if exhausted |

The IC table stores observed types, cached method pointers, and field offsets. On first execution, the IC slot is empty and the instruction takes the slow generic path. On subsequent executions, the cached information provides a fast path. If the observed type changes (deoptimization), the IC slot is cleared and reverts to generic.

### Tier 2 — Superinstructions and Domain Operations (0xA0–0xBF)

Fused instruction sequences and domain-specific operations added by the **load-time rewriting pass** (§8). Never emitted by the compiler directly. The VM rewrites Tier 0 sequences into Tier 2 equivalents when profitable.

| Opcode | Hex | Form | Semantics |
|--------|-----|------|-----------|
| `ADD_REGS` | `0xA0` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB + rC` (int-only, no type check — post-specialization) |
| `LOOP_TEST` | `0xA1` | `rA, rB, imm8` | `if !(rA < rB): pc += imm8 * 4`. Fused compare-and-branch for loop headers. |
| `RETURN_REG` | `0xA2` | `rA, _, _` | Equivalent to `RETURN rA` but skips frame teardown checks for leaf functions |
| `CALL_STORE` | `0xA3` | `rA, rB, rC` | Call `rB` with `rC` args, store result directly in `rA`. Fused call+move. |
| `STRUCT_COPY` | `0xA4` | `rA, rB, imm8` | Copy `imm8` consecutive registers from `rB..rB+imm8` to `rA..rA+imm8` |
| `BULK_ZERO` | `0xA5` | `rA, imm16` | Zero `imm16` consecutive registers starting at `rA` |
| `SLICE` | `0xA6` | `rA, rB, rC` | `rA = rB[rC.start..rC.end]` (array/string slice) |
| `INC_REG` | `0xA7` | `rA, _, _` | `rA = rA + 1` (integer only, no type check) |
| `DEC_REG` | `0xA8` | `rA, _, _` | `rA = rA - 1` |
| `CMP_JUMP_EQ` | `0xA9` | `rA, rB, imm8` | `if rA == rB: pc += imm8 * 4`. Fused compare-and-branch for match cases. |

---

## 7. Type Specialization

Generic arithmetic instructions (`ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`, `CMP_LT`) perform runtime type dispatch on every execution. Type specialization eliminates this overhead after the first execution reveals operand types.

**Quickened typed variants** (range `0xC0–0xDF`):

| Generic | Int variant | Float variant | Hex |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-----|
| `ADD` (0x03) | `ADD_INT` | `ADD_FLOAT` | `0xC0`, `0xC1` |
| `SUB` (0x04) | `SUB_INT` | `SUB_FLOAT` | `0xC2`, `0xC3` |
| `MUL` (0x05) | `MUL_INT` | `MUL_FLOAT` | `0xC4`, `0xC5` |
| `DIV` (0x06) | `DIV_INT` | `DIV_FLOAT` | `0xC6`, `0xC7` |
| `CMP_LT` (0x07) | `CMP_LT_INT` | `CMP_LT_FLOAT` | `0xC8`, `0xC9` |
| `CMP_EQ` (0x20) | `CMP_EQ_INT` | `CMP_EQ_FLOAT` | `0xCA`, `0xCB` |
| `LOAD_CONST` (0x02) | `LOAD_CONST_INT` | `LOAD_CONST_FLOAT` | `0xCC`, `0xCD` |

The VM rewrites the opcode byte in-place after the first execution. If types change at that instruction site (deoptimization), the opcode reverts to generic and retries. This is CPython 3.11's PEP 659 approach, designed into UL's instruction set from the start.

---

## 8. Load-Time Rewriting

On first load of a `.ulb` file, the VM runs a **bytecode rewriting pass** before execution begins. This pass:

1. **Sequence fusion.** Scans for Tier 0 instruction sequences that match Tier 2 superinstruction patterns and rewrites them in-place. Because instructions are fixed 32-bit width, replacing a multi-instruction sequence with a superinstruction + NOPs is a simple aligned write. Example: `CMP_LT r3 r0 r1` + `JUMP_IF_FALSE r3 +4` becomes `LOOP_TEST r0 r1 +5` + `NOP`.

2. **Handler reindexing.** The VM may remap opcode values in the loaded bytecode to reorder dispatch table entries for this specific program's hot paths. If profiling (via block metadata hotness counters) shows that `ADD` and `CALL` dominate, the VM can swap their dispatch table positions so they occupy adjacent I-cache lines. This is transparent to semantics — the remapping is applied to both the bytecode and the dispatch table atomically.

3. **IC table allocation.** For each Tier 1 instruction, the VM allocates an inline cache slot in a per-function side table. The `ic_slot` operand in Tier 1 instructions indexes into this table. The table is not part of the `.ulb` file — it is allocated at load time and populated during execution.

The rewriting pass runs once per function on first load. Subsequent invocations of the same function use the rewritten bytecode. The original `.ulb` file on disk is never modified.

## 9. Example

UL source:

```
function main() returns int
  int x = 3
  int y = 4
  print x + y
  return 0
end function
```

Bytecode (function `main`, 0 params, 3 registers: r0=x, r1=y, r2=temp):

```
LOAD_CONST  r0, #0       ; r0 = 3  (constant pool index 0)
LOAD_CONST  r1, #1       ; r1 = 4  (constant pool index 1)
ADD         r2, r0, r1   ; r2 = r0 + r1 = 7
PRINT       r2           ; print 7
LOAD_CONST  r0, #2       ; r0 = 0  (constant pool index 2)
RETURN      r0           ; return 0
```

Constant pool: `[int 3, int 4, int 0]`

Hex encoding (6 instructions × 4 bytes = 24 bytes):

```
02 00 00 00   ; LOAD_CONST r0, const[0]
02 01 01 00   ; LOAD_CONST r1, const[1]
03 02 00 01   ; ADD r2, r0, r1
0B 02 00 00   ; PRINT r2
02 00 02 00   ; LOAD_CONST r0, const[2]
0A 00 00 00   ; RETURN r0
```

After load-time rewriting, the VM may fuse instructions 0–1 into `BULK_ZERO` + two `LOAD_CONST_INT` (if quickening determines all constants are int).

## 10. Dataflow Regions (Mini-SSA)

Within each basic block, the bytecode observes **single-assignment discipline**: each register is written at most once per block. No register is reassigned within a block boundary. Each block has a single entry point and a single exit (the terminator instruction).

```
block_3:
  r1 = LOAD_CONST #0        ; r1 defined once
  r2 = LOAD_CONST #1        ; r2 defined once
  r3 = ADD r1, r2           ; r3 defined once, consumes r1 and r2
  r4 = MUL r3, r5           ; r4 defined once
  JUMP_IF_FALSE r4, +3      ; single exit
```

This is not full SSA (no phi nodes, no dominance frontiers) but provides the key benefits within a region:

- **Interpreter stays simple.** No phi resolution, no register renaming at block boundaries. The interpreter executes instructions sequentially as before.
- **JIT gets SSA for free.** Within a block, every register write is a definition and every read is a use of that definition. The JIT can build SSA form trivially by treating each block as a single extended basic block.
- **Constant propagation and dead code elimination** work within blocks without any additional analysis. If `r1 = LOAD_CONST 5` and `r3 = ADD r1, r2`, the JIT can fold `r1` into the ADD without a data-flow pass.
- **Vectorization hooks.** Consecutive arithmetic on adjacent registers within a single-assignment block can be trivially identified for SIMD lowering.

The compiler enforces single-assignment within blocks. At block boundaries, values flow through registers that persist across the transition (the register file is shared across blocks within a function). The block metadata successor edges (§2.6) provide the connection points.

## 11. Reserved Ranges

| Range | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `0x01–0x7F` | Tier 0 primitive operations |
| `0x80–0x9F` | Tier 1 semantic operations with IC slots |
| `0xA0–0xBF` | Tier 2 superinstructions and domain operations |
| `0xC0–0xDF` | Quickened type-specialized variants (VM-internal, never on disk) |
| `0xE0–0xEF` | Reserved for future tiers |
| `0xF0–0xFE` | Reserved for future use (closures, coroutines, DR enforcement) |
| `0xFF` | `NOP` — no operation (used as padding after superinstruction fusion) |

---

## 12. Versioning

The major version increments on breaking changes to the instruction encoding or file format. The minor version increments on backward-compatible additions (new opcodes in unused ranges). A VM must reject files with a major version it does not support. A VM should accept files with a minor version greater than its own, executing unknown Tier 1/2 opcodes via their Tier 0 expansions stored in the block metadata.

---

## 13. Future Directions

Planned investigations for v2.0+. These are not part of the v1.0 spec but influence current design decisions (opcode space reservation, instruction width, metadata tables).

**Register windowing.** SPARC-style sliding register windows per function call. Instead of saving and restoring the entire register file on `CALL`/`RETURN`, each function gets a window of registers that overlaps with its caller's window. Arguments are passed through the overlap region with zero copy. This eliminates register save/restore overhead for non-recursive call chains and reduces call overhead to a window-pointer adjustment.

**Predictive dispatch.** Encode the likely-next-opcode in each instruction's unused bits or in a side table. The handler for instruction N ends with `goto *dispatch_table[predicted_next]` instead of reading the next opcode from the instruction stream. If the prediction is correct (common — `LOAD_CONST` is almost always followed by `STORE_LOCAL` or an arithmetic op), the handler executes immediately with no indirect branch. If wrong, fall back to normal dispatch. This converts the most common dispatch sequences into direct jumps.

**SIMD instruction bundles.** A `BUNDLE` meta-instruction that packs 2–4 independent operations into a single dispatch:

```
BUNDLE [ADD r1,r2,r3 | ADD r4,r5,r6 | SUB r7,r8,r9 | NOP]
```

The VM dispatches once and executes all four operations, which the JIT can lower to a single SIMD instruction on architectures that support it (SSE/AVX on x86, NEON on ARM). Useful for vector math, bulk array operations, and struct field initialization.

**Continuation-passing bytecode.** Encode function returns as continuations rather than stack unwinding. Each `CALL` encodes its return continuation explicitly, enabling zero-cost tail calls (the continuation of a tail call is the caller's continuation) and zero-cost async (suspending a coroutine captures the continuation, resuming jumps to it). This eliminates the call stack for tail-recursive functions and makes async/await a control-flow decision rather than a runtime mechanism.

**Side-exit first design.** Encode the hot path as the straight-line instruction sequence with explicit side exits at guard points. Guards check invariants (type checks, bounds checks, overflow) and branch to cold deoptimization stubs only on failure. The hot path executes with no branches — all guards are "fall-through on success." This is the architecture JIT compilers like V8 TurboFan and LuaJIT use internally; encoding it in the bytecode lets the interpreter benefit from the same pattern before JIT is triggered.
