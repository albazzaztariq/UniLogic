## What is Pragma?

Pragma is a statically-typed systems language that transpiles to C. Designed to be readable to anyone who has written code in any modern language, while providing access to the full hardware stack when needed.

Standard Pragma reads like natural language. Base Pragma adds memory management, pointers, and bitwise operations in the same file — no mode switch, no separate language.

**Example — `container_of`.** Recovering a struct from a pointer to one of its members. A pattern used throughout the Linux kernel.

## Compiler

Requires Python 3 and clang or gcc.

## Safety

Pragma targets mathematically proven memory safety and functional correctness via Frama-C with the WP plugin. You can find a [brief here](pragma-project.github.io/Pragma-Language/Safety.md) or see the [Safety page](https://pragma-project.github.io/Pragma-Language/safety.html) for the full methodology.

## Dynamic Runtime

Pragma exposes 12 runtime settings — memory model, allocator, overflow behaviour, stack size, bounds checking, float semantics, and more — declared per source file at compile time. No global defaults, no hidden language choices. See the [Runtime Policy page](https://pragma-project.github.io/Pragma-Language/runtime-policy.html) for all settings.
